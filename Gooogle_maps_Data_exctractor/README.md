This main objective is to use google-maps and exctract data based on the input.

For example A search on the search bar for <dentist> all the results are filtered taking only the name of the Dental, location, website and phone number.
Since google-maps doesn't provide the emails, there is another scraper that goes to the website to extract the email.

The scraper will be onyl taking the first 5 from the  search results.
